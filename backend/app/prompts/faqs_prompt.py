### What if I don't receive the code?
You should have received an SMS with your code by now. If it isn't there, you may hit resend again. If you still didn't receive the code, you may have provided the wrong number. If that is the case, you will receive a call from us.

### Will my order be placed if I don't send the code?
Yes, your order has been placed; this process just helps us to provide better customer service. We highly recommend that you submit the code for a faster delivery.

### How can I track my order?
